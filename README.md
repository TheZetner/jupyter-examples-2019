===

## Launch the Notebooks Interactively. Click here => [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/TheZetner/jupyter-examples-2019/master)

[Binder](https://gke.mybinder.org/) is a service that turns a Git repo into a collection of interactive notebooks.  
You'll enjoy the experience of Jupyter Dashboard and notebooks in the cloud.

## Run the notebooks on [Microsoft Azure](https://notebooks.azure.com/TheZetner/projects/jupyter-examples-2019)

Azure is a similar service as Binder allowing the user to run jupyter notebooks with a limited number of kernels.
